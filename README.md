From a young age, computers have been my constant source of curiosity, sparking a passion that continues to grow with every passing day.

 My journey into Software Development has been more than just a specialization; it’s been a gateway to turning imaginative ideas and real-world scenarios into functional projects. 

With 2 years of experience in the industry, I’ve honed my skills in Vanilla js ,Node.js, and React.js allowing me to not only innovate but also solve complex challenges with creativity and precision.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working on Rembotrack.com that is on its development stage where I’ve contributed improving system efficiency and creating its UI from scratch. 

My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in software, always driven by the same curiosity that got me started at the first place
